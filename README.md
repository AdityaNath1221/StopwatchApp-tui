# ⏱️ Textual Stopwatch App

A simple **terminal-based stopwatch application** built using **Python** and the **Textual** framework.  
This project follows the official Textual tutorial and exists for one reason:  
👉 *to learn how modern TUIs actually work.*

Terminals aren’t boring. We just weren’t using them right.

## 🚀 Features

- ▶️ Start / ⏸️ Stop / 🔄 Reset stopwatch
- ⏱️ Real-time time updates in terminal

## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

This project helped me understand:

- Basics of the **Textual framework**
- How **widgets, events, and layouts** work in TUIs
- State management in terminal applications
- Timers, async tasks, and event-driven updates
- Structuring a small but clean Python project
- Why TUIs are underrated and lowkey powerful

This is a beginner project, but a **foundational** one.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Textual**
- **Rich** (used internally by Textual)
